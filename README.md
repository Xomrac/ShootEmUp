# ShootEmUp
A simple demo to test the use of creational patterns
## PATTERN USED
- Object pool to handle the spawn of enemies, bullets and particles
- Builder & factory to handle the creation and setupping of the spawned elements
- Strategy to handle the behaviour of bullets and weapons
- Service Locator to handle the management of all the different parts of an entity (movement, health, weapons...)
